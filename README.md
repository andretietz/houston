# Houston
A kotlin library to abstract tracking tools.

## How to use
### Add the libary from `mavenCentral`
```groovy
implementation "com.andretietz.houston:houston:x.y.z"
```
### Snapshot versions

Snapshot versions are available, by adding the mavenCentral snapshot repository

```groovy
maven { url { "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" } }
```

and adding `-SNAPSHOT` to the version number:

```groovy
implementation "com.andretietz.houston:houston:x.y.z-SNAPSHOT'
```
### Initialize Houston
Whenever you forgot to initialize it, no events will be sent. This could be used 
e.g. to avoid tracking on a development environment. 
```kotlin
Houston.init(optionalCoroutineScope)
  .add(someAnalyticsTool1) 
  .add(someAnalyticsTool2)
  .launch(optionalCoroutineExceptionHandler)
```

### Fire events
Example for login success or not:
```kotlin
...
{ loginSuccess: Boolean, data: String? -> 

  // a string to identify the event (id: String)
  Houston.send(LoginTracker.LOGIN) 
    // optional argument(s) (key: String, value: String?)
    .with(LoginTracker.LOGIN_KEY_SUCCESS, loginSuccess.toString())
    // the value can be nullable. in this case it will not be added.
    .with(LoginTracker.LOGIN_KEY_DATA, data)
    ...
    .over()
  ...
}
```

### Implement a tracking tool
This is sample of an non-existing tracking tool called WhateverAnalytics, in which you create an event which you send 
using their analytics instance.
```kotlin
class WhateverAnalyticsTrackingTool(private val whateverAnalytics: WhateverAnalytics) : TrackingTool {
  override fun send(message: Message) {
    val event = WhateverEvent(message.id)
    message.data.forEach { key, value ->
      event.addData(key, value)
    }
    whateverAnalytics.track(event)
  }
}
```

## Intention
Whenever you're working on a product (probably not that much, when working on projects),
from time to time you need to add, update or remove certain tracking tools such as: google analytics, localytics, adjust from your code.
This is a pain because every time you want to achieve one of it, you need to touch every
piece of code wherever you added a tracking event.

To avoid this we created abstractions (in several iterations), so that every tracking tool is implementing a certain interface
and you fire events independent of the actual tool. The library is not a huge master piece nor is it
a lot of code you save to write. It's only to avoid writing those lines all over again.

Initially I used this in android projects, but since it doesn't have any Android dependencies you could use it in
every Java/Kotlin project. 

## About
The name and usage of the library has analogies to NASA Space missions.

A tracking tool relates to a crew-member of mission control and the application relates
to a spaceship that sends data to mission control.
