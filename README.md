# Houston
A kotlin library to abstract tracking tools.

## How to use
### Add the libary from `mavenCentral`
```groovy
implement("com.andretietz.houston:houston:x.y.z")
```
### Initialize Houston
Whenever you forgot to initialize it, no events will be sent. This could be used 
e.g. to avoid tracking on a development environment. 
```kotlin
Houston.init()
  .add(someAnalyticsTool1) 
  .add(someAnalyticsTool2)
  .launch()
```

### Fire events
Example for login success or not:
```kotlin
...
{ loginSuccess: Boolean -> 

  // a string to identify the event (id: String)
  Houston.createMessage(LoginTracker.LOGIN) 
    // optional argument(s) (key: String, value: String)
    .with(LoginTracker.LOGIN_KEY_SUCCESS, loginSuccess.toString())
    .with(...)
    ...
    .over()
  ...
}
```

### Implement a tracking tool
This is sample of an non-existing tracking tool called WhateverAnalytics, in which you create an event which you send 
using their analytics instance.
```kotlin
class WhateverAnalyticsCrewMember(private val whateverAnalytics: WhateverAnalytics) : CrewMember {
  override fun send(message: Message) {
    val event = WhateverEvent(message.id)
    message.data.forEach { key, value ->
      event.addData(key, value)
    }
    whateverAnalytics.track(event)
  }
}
```

## Intention
Whenever you're working on a product (probably not that much, when working on projects),
from time to time you need to add, update or remove certain tracking tools such as: google analytics, localytics, adjust from your code.
This is a pain because every time you want to achieve one of it, you need to touch every
piece of code wherever you added a tracking event.

To avoid this we created abstractions (in several iterations), so that every tracking tool is implementing a certain interface
and you fire events independent of the actual tool. The library is not a huge master piece nor is it
a lot of code you save to write. It's only to avoid writing those lines all over again.

Initially I used this in android projects, but since it doesn't have any Android dependencies you could use it in
every Java/Kotlin project. 

## About
The name and usage of the library have analogies to the NASA Apollo 13 mission. 

A tracking tool relates to a crewmember of mission control and the application relates 
to a spaceship that sends data to mission control.
